The program is coded in C.

Input the number of threads that is needed to group and process matrix multiplication row wise.

In order to take the inputs from the text file, upload the text files with the names matA & matB containing the two matrices.

The provided matrices in the two text files are 300x300. 


Output values can be seen in the excel sheet. The graph is plotted based on microseconds. 

The interval of the values of matrix size used to plot the graph is in such a way that it starts from 0 to 1000 with increments of 40.
Then after 1000 the the output of the program has been taken for the matrix size of 2000 and 5000.
